# BUILD YOUR OWN WORLD GAME

## Project Description

This is a Java-based project that generates a 2D tile-based world with rooms, hallways, and an interactive avatar. The world is rendered using the Princeton Tiled Engine (TETile) and user interaction is handled through keyboard input or predefined input strings. The avatar travels through this world collecting food. 

## Technologies Used

* Tech 1 - version 1.0
* Tech 2 - version 2.0
* Tech 3 - version 3.0

## Features

* Procedural World Generation
   * Rooms and hallways are generated by partitioning the map randomly using a seed.
* Avatar Movement
   * Control an avatar using W, A, S, D keys. Movement is constrained by walls.
* Food Collection Mechanic
   * Collect food placed randomly on the floor tiles to increase your score.
* Save & Load Functionality
   * Game state (seed, avatar position, food location, and score) is saved to and loaded from a text file.
* Heads-Up Display (HUD)
   * Mouse hover displays tile descriptions, and score is shown during gameplay.
* Zoomed View Toggle
   * Press F to toggle a small local view around the avatar.

To-do list:
* Wow improvement to be done 1
* Wow improvement to be done 2
